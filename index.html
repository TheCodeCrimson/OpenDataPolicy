        </h2>
          <section>
            <p>Open data refers to information such as documents, databases, records, or transcripts, including those managed by outside vendors, that is released by a government or organization. Open data should be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freely available</strong> to be used, shared, and reused by anyone for any purpose, commercial or otherwise</li>
                <li><strong>Available in digital, machine-readable formats</strong> (such as .csv) so that it can be used in combination with other data and applications</li>
                <li><strong>Available in its entirety</strong>, including the ability to be downloaded “in bulk” instead of being manually retrieved record-by-record</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How much will it cost?</h2>
            <p>"There has been a range of budgeted numbers attached to legislation for funding open data efforts. Generally, anywhere from $0 (if no one is hired and no additional money is needed for technology) to $500,000 (for hiring new staff and adopting new technology) may be budgeted for city, state, or federal open data initiatives. Funding should be considered for — but not limited to — potential expenses such as new staff (administrative, technical, and legal), new software (to house, extract, and input data), training, and server maintenance. It will be important for each jurisdiction to consider what it needs to support a strong open data ecosystem."</p>
